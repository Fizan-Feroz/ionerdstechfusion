- Code: https://github.com/scai-lab/GARLIC
- Authors: Ruirui Wang, Yanke Li, Manuel Günther, Diego Paez-Granados

SynCura extends GARLIC's attention-based approach with LSTM (lighter than graph attention), SpO2 features, early stopping, SHAP explainability, and a deployable full-stack system (FastAPI + React).

### Abstract

Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient deterioration remains a leading cause of preventable in-hospital mortality. Traditional scoring systems like NEWS2 rely on static thresholds and fail to capture temporal trends in physiological data. This project presents **SynCura**, a real-time ICU monitoring system that uses an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict patient deterioration risk from continuous vital sign streams. The system integrates a FastAPI backend for real-time inference, a React dashboard for clinical visualization, and SHAP-based explainability for transparent, interpretable predictions. Trained and evaluated on the PhysioNet 2012 Challenge dataset, the model uses 6 physiological features (Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Temperature, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, and SpO2) with a 60-minute sliding window. The attention mechanism enables per-timestep interpretability, identifying which moments in a patient's trajectory most influenced the risk prediction.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Statement

ICU patients are highly vulnerable, with mortality rates ranging from 10-29%. Early detection of clinical deterioration can significantly improve outcomes, yet current clinical practice relies on manual scoring systems (NEWS2, SOFA, APACHE-II) that:
- Use static thresholds on individual readings
- Fail to capture temporal trends
- Require manual calculation
- Have limited sensitivity for early detection

#### 1.2 Objectives

1. Develop a deep learning model (LSTM with attention) for real-time ICU mortality risk prediction
2. Build a full-stack system with FastAPI backend and React frontend
3. Integrate explainability via attention weights and SHAP values
4. Compare against the clinical baseline NEWS2 scoring system
5. Enable real-time scenario simulation for demonstration

### 4. Methodology

#### 4.1 Dataset

**PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012**
- 4,000 ICU patients (age >= 16)
- 37 time-series variables recorded over 48 hours
- Binary mortality outcome (survived/died)
- Physiological variables sampled at irregular intervals

#### 4.2 Feature Selection

6 vital signs selected based on clinical relevance and literature:

| Feature | PhysioNet Name | Clinical Significance |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Heart Rate | HR | Cardiovascular stability |
| Respiratory Rate | RespRate | Respiratory failure indicator |
| Temperature | Temp | Infection/sepsis marker |
| Systolic BP | NISysABP | Hemodynamic status |
| Diastolic BP | NIDiasABP | Perfusion pressure |
| SpO2 | SpO2 | Oxygenation status |

#### 4.3 Data Preprocessing

1. **Sliding Window**: 60-minute windows with 1-minute stride
2. **Interpolation**: Linear interpolation for missing values within each window
3. **Normalization**: Z-score normalization: `(x - mean) / (std + 1e-6)`
4. **Padding**: Zero-padding for sequences shorter than window size
5. **Patient-level Split**: 80/20 train/val split using GroupShuffleSplit (prevents data leakage)

#### 4.4 Model Architecture: AttentionLSTMModel

```
Input (batch, 60, 6)
    |
    v
LSTM (input=6, hidden=64, layers=2, dropout=0.3)
    |
    v
Attention Layer:
  Linear(64 -> 64) -> Tanh -> Linear(64 -> 1)
    |
    v
Softmax over time steps
    |
    v
Weighted Sum (context vector)
    |
    v
Dropout(0.3) -> BatchNorm1d(64)
    |
    v
Linear(64 -> 1) -> Sigmoid
    |
    v
Output: Risk Probability (0-1)
```

Key design choices:
- **Additive attention** (Bahdanau-style) for interpretability
- **Batch normalization** for training stability
- **Dropout (0.3)** for regularization
- **pos_weight** in BCE loss for class imbalance

#### 4.5 Training Strategy

- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=1e-3)
- **Loss**: Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy with pos_weight
- **Early Stopping**: Patience=5 epochs on validation AUC
- **Min Delta**: 0.001 AUC improvement required

### 6. Results and Evaluation

#### 6.1 Model Performance

After training with AttentionLSTM + early stopping:

| Metric | Expected Range | Literature Benchmark |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| AUC-ROC | 0.80-0.90 | DEWS: 0.880 [8] |
| Accuracy | 85-92% | ARLF: 90.3% [9] |
