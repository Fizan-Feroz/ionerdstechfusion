3. Metrics preview should match monitoring page
4. ✅ PASS - Job list reflects updates

### Test 5: Error Handling
1. Try creating job with invalid path
2. Should display error message
3. Job should appear in list with "failed" status
4. ✅ PASS - Error handling works

## Integration Points

### Backend ↔ Frontend Communication

**REST API Calls:**
- Frontend: `axios.post('/training/start')` → Backend: `POST /training/start`
- Frontend: `axios.get('/training/jobs')` → Backend: `GET /training/jobs`
- Frontend: `axios.get('/training/{id}')` → Backend: `GET /training/{job_id}`

**Authentication:** None (development mode with `allow_origins=["*"]`)

**Data Format:** JSON

**Error Handling:** HTTPException on backend, axios error catching on frontend

### Database Integration
- TrainingJob metadata stored in SQLite
- Model checkpoints saved to disk
- Metrics persisted via job.to_dict()

### ML Pipeline Integration
- Uses existing `ml.train` and `ml.train_lstm` modules
- Loads PhysioNet 2012 dataset
- Trains LSTM model
- Evaluates and computes metrics

3. **File paths required** - No file browser UI
4. **No model export** - Models not downloadable
5. **No authentication** - Development mode only

### Planned Enhancements
1. WebSocket support for real-time updates
